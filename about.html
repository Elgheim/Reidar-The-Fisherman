      <h1>Reidar The Fisherman</h1>
      <p>Reidar was born in 1930. He grew up in Oslo and were from a workingclass
      familiy. During the second world work, economy were extremly tight, so
      he learn to fish to help provide his family. Even though Oslo was taken
      by the germans, there were some normality when sitting at SÃ¸renga with only him
      self and the fishingrod. The places where he fished as a teenager, are completly
      transformed today, but his love for fishing are still with him. Even though he
      is more a sportsfisher today, he still finds a special appreciation by catching
      his own meal.</p>
