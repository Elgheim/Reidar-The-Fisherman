      <h1>Nesodden</h1>
      <p>Travel by boat or car. Wonderfull scenerary for a day fishing.<br>
        Nesodden isn't the best place, neither scenery or water quality, but it's
        definitly the best place for merling. This is the place where I get the most and
        largest, so it makes it hard not to grab the list. Close to the boat pire, it's
        the deepest, and this is where they like to be. <br>
        Merling likes live bait, and goes deep. Do use whatever at hand, easiest worms, a let
        the hook go right over the bottom.
