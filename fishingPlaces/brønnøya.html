      <h1>Brønnøya</h1>
      <p>A smal walk from Nesøya, you will find beauftifull landscape and amazing fishing.<br>
        There are no cars at Brønnøya, and even though there are a lot of cabins,
        theres a peacefullness out here. At the south-east end, you will have a
        mightfull view over the Oslofjord. If I want mackerel, this is were I go.
        Remember to bring a bucket, bacause if you get one, a lot more is coming! <br>
        I usually use cut herring, but if you don't have that at hand, a spoon lure also does
        the trick.
