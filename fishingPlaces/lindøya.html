      <h1>Lindøya</h1>
      <p>One boat ride. A short wolk. There you have it. Oslofjord at it's finest.<br>
        This is probably the most beutifull place at the list and the most unaccesble.
        There are Ferries going out to Lindøya, and when you arrive, it doesn't feel like Oslo
        anymore. The oceans soothing sounds and only you and the nature there. There are
        many good spots, but at the south-western end, is where i go. Few people and
        an amazing view. Sea trout is not uncommon, so that is what I'm fishing for there. <br>
        Same as Brønnøya, I usually use cut herring, but if you don't have that at hand, a spoon lure also does
        the trick.
