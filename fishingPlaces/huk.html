      <h1>Huk</h1>
      <p>Huk is maybe most known for their beach, but there is also
        trout to be found! <br>
        A hot summer day in July might not be the best time of the year to visit
        this place, but as soon as the temperature is colder, the people get fewer
        and the fishes get more. Pollock, sea trout, cod and mackerel are some of
        the favourites you can catch here. <br>
        Here I usually use a universal fishing lure, because the catch rate is
        very good, and you can get all kinds of suprises.
