      <p>Easy acceble and easy catches. Perfect place for a familiy trip.<br>
        Snarøya is a perfect place for a familiy trip. You can drive all the way,
        and it's wonderfull beaches. This is like the littlebrother of Huk. You can
        catch all sorts of fishtypes here. If you want to teach your children to fish
        this is a great place. Throw a dip out and wait until it bites! <br>
        You can use a universal spoon lure or a dip with hook.
